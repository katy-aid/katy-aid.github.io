# Planning

## All New Resources
- Add urls to databases
- Add site images to assets (following previously established naming convention)
- Add each category to map

## All Old Resources
- Add subcategory headings

## All Resources
- Restructure images and ids for resources within subcategories
    - Create image folders for each subcategory within its category folder
    - Start id counts from 0 for each subcategory
    - Ensure images match up with sites
- Fix vertical margin of resource cards when description is longer than 2 lines
- Make height of image consistent (not dependent on height of description)
- Add buttons for subcategories at top of each resource page (when applicable)

## General
- Restructure home page
- Turn current map into sitemap
- Create map for subcategories (with places that have physical locations) to show accurate locations but with custom icons (maybe image of site)
