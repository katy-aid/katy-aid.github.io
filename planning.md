# Planning

## All New Resources
- Add urls to databases
- Add site images to assets
- Add each category to map

## All Old Resources
- Add subcategory headings

## All Resources
- Fix placement of descriptions
    - Ensure i is fixed for all ids (i + length of previous subcategory - 1 + length of other previous subcategory - 1...), subtracting 1 from each length
    - Only 1st resource of each subcategory (except 1st subcategory of each category) is wrong?
- Consider making height of image consistent and not dependent on height of description
- Fix vertical margin of resource cards when screen width gets smaller
